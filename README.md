# Audio Processing Web
This web application uses wavesurfer.js (https://wavesurfer-js.org/) and Praat (https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) to visualize audio waveform and analyse its pitch, intensity, and formants. You can also process the audio by converting it from stereo to mono or reducing its noise, then download the processed audio.

To zoom the audio you can either
* Use the slider below the graph, or
* Choose the start and end time, then click 'Zoom', or
* Select the desired part by dragging on the waveform, then click 'Zoom'
